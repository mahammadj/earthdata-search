## About
Earthdata Search is a web application developed by [NASA](http://nasa.gov) [EOSDIS](https://earthdata.nasa.gov)
to enable data discovery, search, comparison, visualization, and access across EOSDIS' Earth Science data holdings.
It builds upon several public-facing services provided by EOSDIS, including
the [Common Metadata Repository (CMR)](https://cmr.earthdata.nasa.gov/search/) for data discovery and access,
EOSDIS [User Registration System (URS)](https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov) authentication,
the [Global Imagery Browse Services (GIBS)](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/gibs) for visualization,
and a number of OPeNDAP services hosted by data providers.

## Application Installation and Usage

The Earthdata Search application uses Node v10.15.1 and Webpack 4.24.0 to generate static assets. The serverless application utilizes the following AWS services (important to note if deploying to an AWS environment):
- S3
  - We highly recommend using CloudFront in front of S3.
- SQS
- API Gateway
- Lambda
- Cloudwatch (Events)

### Prerequisites

##### Node
Earthdata Search runs on Node.js, in order to run the application you'll need to [install it](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

**Recommended:** Use Homebrew

	brew install node

##### NPM
npm is a separate project from Node.js, and tends to update more frequently. As a result, even if you’ve just downloaded Node.js (and therefore npm), you’ll probably need to update your npm. Luckily, npm knows how to update itself! To update your npm, type this into your terminal:

    npm install -g npm@latest

##### NVM
To ensure that you're using the correct version of Node it is recommended that you use Node Version Manager. Installation instructions can be found on [the repository](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#install--update-script). The version used is defined in .nvmrc and will be used automatically if NVM is configured correctly.


##### Serverless Framework
Earthdata Search utilizes the [Serverless Framework](https://serverless.com/) for managing AWS resources. In order to fully run and manage the application you'll need to install it:

    npm install -g serverless@latest

##### PostgreSQL
Earthdata Search uses PostgreSQL in production on AWS RDS. If you don't already have it installed, [download](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) and install it to your development environment.

**Recommended:** Use Homebrew

    brew install postgresql

If you decide to install via Homebrew you'll need to create the default user.

    /usr/local/opt/postgres/bin/createuser -s postgres

### Initial Setup

##### Package Installation

Once npm is installed locally, you need to download the dependencies by executing the command below in the project root directory:

    npm install

##### Configuration

###### Secrets

For local development Earthdata Search uses a json configuration file to store secure files, an example is provided and should be copied and completed before attempting to go any further.

	cp secret.config.json.example secret.config.json

In order to operate against a local database this file will need `dbUsername` and `dbPassword` values set (you may need to update `dbHost`, `dbName` or `dbPort` in `static.config.json` if you have custom configuration locally)

###### Public (Non-Secure)
Non-secure values are stored in `static.config.json`. In order to prevent conflicts amongst developers you copy the static config into `overrideStatic.config.json` and change the config values there. Do not commit changes to `static.config.json`.

    cp static.config.json overrideStatic.config.json

##### Database Migration

Ensure that you have a database created:

	createdb edsc_dev

Our database migrations run within Lambda due to the fact that in non-development environments our resources are not publicly accessible. To run the migrations you'll need to invoke the Lambda:

	serverless invoke local --function migrateDatabase


### Building the Application

The production build of the application will be output in the `/static/dist/` directory:

    npm run build


### Run the Application Locally

The local development environment for the static assets can be started by executing the command below in the project root directory:

    npm run start

This will run the React application at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) -- please see `Serverless Framework` below for enabling the 'server' side functionality.


### Serverless Framework

The [serverless framework](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/) offers many plugins which allow for local development utilizing many of the services AWS offers. For the most part we only need API Gateway and Lambda for this application but there are plugins for many more services (a list of known exceptions will be maintained below).

##### Exceptions
- SQS

	While there is an sqs-offline plugin for serverless it still requires an actual queue be running, we may investigate this in the future but for now sqs functionality isn't available while developing locally which means the following pieces of functionality will not operate locally:
	- Generating Colormaps

#### Running API Gateway and Lambda Locally

Running the following command will spin up API Gateway and Lambda locally which will open up a vast majority of the functionality the backend offers.

	serverless offline

This will provide access to API Gateway at [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001)

Additionally, this ties in with the `serverless webpack` plugin which will ensure that your lambdas are re-built when changes are detected.


### Run the Automated [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) tests

Once the project is built, you must ensure that the automated unit tests pass:

    npm run test

### Run the Automated [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) tests

You must also ensure that the automated integration tests pass:

    npm run cypress:run

You can also use the Cypress GUI with:

    npm run cypress:open


##### Configuration

###### Cypress Secrets

When adding new Cypress tests, you will need to modify the secrets.config.json file. You will need to edit the "cypress" object to include data from your local database:

    "cypress": {
        "user": {
        "id": 1, // This should match the ID of your user in the 'users' database table
        "username": "your username here" // Replace with the urs_id field of your user in the 'users' database table
        }
    }

### Deployment

When the time comes to deploy the application, first ensure that you have the required ENV vars set:

- AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
- AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY

This application runs in a VPC for NASA security purposes, therefore the following values are expected when a deployment occurs:

- VPC_ID
- SUBNET_ID_A
- SUBNET_ID_B

For production use, this application uses Scatter Swap to obfuscate some IDs -- the library does not require a value be provided but if you'd like to control it you can set the following ENV vars:

- OBFUSCATION_SPIN
- OBFUSCATION_SPIN_SHAPEFILES

To deploy the full application use the following:

	NODE_ENV=production serverless deploy --stage UNIQUE_STAGE
